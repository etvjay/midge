# Programme: the next use cases, in build order

*Written 2026-11-07. Each item follows the lab loop: limits and predictions written before the run, a public or multisig baseline, a testnet run, an independent audit, mutation tests, and a kept failing run when a prediction fails. Layman line under each new term. Deadline: 14 November (7 days).*

## Honest scope

Eight items plus the playground is more than a week of live-tested work. Order is by what each item needs from the previous one. The first four are the core; the rest are cut candidates, listed with what is lost if they are cut.

| # | Item | Needs | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Multisig baseline** | nothing | core (every comparison below needs it) |
| 1 | **Voting and ballot box** | signed inputs (done), item 0 | core |
| 2 | **Payroll, invoicing, receipts, accounting views** | item 0, a receipts layer | core |
| 3 | **RFQ, both sides** (taker buys or sells, makers quote) | the quote program (done) | core |
| 4 | **Playground** | items 1 to 3 as scenarios | core |
| 5 | **Order book with makers and takers** (batch matching, speed and confidentiality measured) | item 3 | next |
| 6 | **Ongoing groups** (several rounds, live) | any program | next |
| 7 | **Rooms that interact** | a design decision | cut candidate |
| 8 | **Paying out on other chains** | a contract change and funded testnet addresses | cut candidate |

## 0. Multisig baseline

A plain on-chain m-of-n treasury: an owner proposes a payment, signers approve in public, anyone executes at the threshold. *Layman: three of five trustees must sign the cheque, and everyone can read who signed.* It is the baseline for voting (a vote by approvals), payroll (a pay run) and quotes (an organizer picks). It trusts the signers: a majority can pay anyone.

## 1. Voting and ballot box

A ballot program: the options are fixed recipients set when the room opens; members seal one choice each, signed by their own key; a later signed ballot replaces an earlier one (re-voting); a quorum and a majority rule decide; only the winner is published, never the tally; the winner decides where the pool goes. *Layman: everyone drops a signed envelope in a box, the clerk announces only who won, and the money goes there.*
**Baselines:** an open on-chain vote; the multisig. **Measured:** votes an observer can infer; how far a last voter can swing an open vote; double and outsider votes refused; the dead-host exit; two hosts.
**Limits up front:** the weight is money (a deposit), not people. No coercion resistance beyond re-voting. A unanimous result is visible only if the tally is published, which it is not, but the count cannot then be checked except by trusting the host (two hosts reduce that).

## 2. Payroll, invoicing, receipts and accounting views

The settlement publishes who is paid and how much, so the amounts cannot be hidden from the chain. What can be hidden is **who the payee is**, and what can be added is **a private paper trail**:
- **Unlinkable payout addresses.** Each pay run pays fresh one-time addresses. The room, not the chain, knows which person each belongs to. *Layman: the cheque is made out to a fresh account number only your employer's clerk can match to your name.*
- **Signed receipts and statements.** The host issues each payee a signed, encrypted receipt (invoice id, period, gross, deductions, net) and an employer-level statement; an auditor gets only category totals. The root of all receipts goes into the signed order hash, which the contract already records, so anyone can check that a receipt belongs to the run without seeing the others. *Layman: you get a stamped statement of your own pay; the auditor gets the totals; the public gets a seal that the totals are real.* This is the **sub-transaction view**: each party sees its own lines.
- **Limit:** a settlement pays at most 8 recipients, so a larger pay run is several settlements. The amounts are public. Receipts prove a payment to its payee; they do not stop a dishonest host from issuing a wrong receipt (two hosts reduce that).
**Baselines:** a public pay run (every name and amount visible); the multisig. **Measured:** how many payees an observer can name from the chain (public: all; unlinkable: none), whether each payee verifies their own receipt against the on-chain root, whether a tampered receipt fails, and whether the auditor's view reveals only totals.

## 3. RFQ, both sides

The quote program today covers lending (lenders quote a rate) and a taker who buys (makers quote a price, lowest wins). Add the taker who sells: makers quote a bid, the highest wins. *Layman: you ask several dealers for a price to buy or to sell; only the best answer is announced.* **Baselines:** an open quote round; the multisig/organizer. **Measured:** as for lending quotes, plus whether the right side wins in both directions.

## 4. Playground

The real host and program code in the browser (pure JavaScript, already), real rules, a sealed-versus-open side-by-side for the scenarios above, clearly labelled a simulation of the chain; then a mode that runs the same scenario on testnet with a wallet. The browser run is the same code the lab tests.

## 5. Order book with makers and takers (frequent batch matching)

Continuous matching rewards speed, so a watcher beats a slower trader. A **frequent batch auction** collects orders for a short epoch and clears them all at one uniform price, which removes the race; the epoch length is the speed knob. *Layman: instead of "first to shout wins", the clerk collects shouts for a few seconds and trades everyone at one fair price.* Makers rest limit orders; takers cross them; partial fills pro-rata at the margin; a new signed order replaces an old one (cancel/replace).
**Measured:** latency from order to fill against epoch length; throughput; what an observer sees; whether a watcher can front-run (open book: yes; sealed batch: no). **Not in v1:** margin, leverage, funding and liquidation. The contract moves NEAR only, so a perpetual's margin and liquidation are not enforced by anything here; calling it a perp book would be false. v1 is a spot-style book with collateral deposits.

## 6. Ongoing groups

A room that lasts several rounds (Dark Vault): deposits between rounds, partial settlements, the exit timer restarting each epoch. Contract tests exist; it has never run live. A live run of three rounds with any of the programs above.

## 7. Rooms that interact (design first)

The simplest sound form: one room's settlement pays into another room's deposit, so a group can fund a sub-group. That needs the paying room's rules to allow a recipient that is itself a room, and care that a payment into a room cannot be pulled back out except by that room's exit. A written design and a decision come before any code. *Layman: a department's budget is paid into another department's account, under both departments' rules.*

## 8. Paying out on other chains

The NEAR contract would ask the Chain Signatures MPC to sign a payment on Ethereum, Bitcoin or Solana, bound to the room's rules. Today that path is a simulation apart from one verified signature. The first milestone is only to sign and broadcast a Sepolia transfer from a derived address funded from a faucet; binding it to a room's release policy is a second, larger contract change.

## Order of work, and what gets cut first

0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are the core. If time runs short the cuts, in order, are 8, 7, 5, 6; each cut item stays in the repository as a written design. Every item's predictions are written into this folder before its run, as with the quote and cross runs.

## Predictions for E-CMP-VOTE-01 (voting), written 2026-11-07 before the run

Five members m1 to m5 each put 0.02 NEAR into a pool of 0.1. Two options: A (recipient ra) and B (recipient rb). Preferences: m1, m2 and m5 prefer A; m3 and m4 prefer B. Quorum 50%, majority rule. Three paths: an **open poll** (our own contract, votes public, a later vote replaces an earlier one); **Midge sealed ballot** (signed ballots, equal deposits, the host counts); a **3-of-5 multisig** whose signers are the five members and which pays whatever three of them approve.

1. **Visibility.** In the open poll an observer reads all 5 votes by account (5 of 5), and before the last vote the public tally is 2 to 2 so the fifth voter knows their vote decides. In the sealed ballot an observer reads 0 of 5 votes; the settlement carries no tally and no turnout, only the pool paid to the winner's recipient and equal charges on all five.
2. **Outcome.** With honest voting both the open poll and the sealed ballot pay the whole 0.1 NEAR to ra (A wins 3 to 2).
3. **Outsiders and doubles.** A non-member's vote is refused or ignored in both. A member voting twice counts once.
4. **The latest vote counts.** In the sealed ballot a member who re-votes changes the outcome in a second, separate round (m3 and m4 switch to A: A wins 5 to 0).
5. **Multisig.** Three of the five signers can send the whole pool to an address outside both options (a thief) and it works; under Midge a payout to a recipient outside the rules is refused by the contract even with a valid host signature (a signing key we hold stands in for a compromised host), and the escrow is intact.
6. **Dead host.** If the host never signs, nothing is paid and all five exit alone with the full 0.02.
7. **Cost.** Total gas of the sealed ballot over the open poll is between 0.5 and 3.
